# Basic movement and ultilization
Our program uses simple, easy to remember controls. This section will explain what they are, and what each input does.

W - Move in the direction you are looking

S - Move in the opposite direction that you are looking

A - Move perpendicularly to the left of where you are looking

D - Move perpendicularly to the right of where you are looking

SPACE - Move perpendicularly upwards of where you are looking

SHIFT - Move perpendicularly downwards of where you are looking

RIGHT MOUSE BUTTON - Hold and move the mouse to look around

LEFT ALT - Hold and move the mouse to tilt the camera

- Mechanics and UI
There are several different mechanics in our program for you, the user, to utilize. This section explains how to utilize them, and how they work.

×Highlighter (Hotkey: LEFT MOUSE BUTTON) - By clicking on an object in the environment with your mouse, you can select it and change some various properties native to that object. (see Properties Panel).

×Properties Panel - The properties panel can be found on the left side of the window in a large, dark box when an object is highlighted. Inside, there are many different properties that you can edit. It will disappear when the object is unhighlighted.

×Global Options Panel and Button (Hotkey: Q) - In the top right corner of your screen, there is a gear icon that when clicked, will enable or disable the global options panel, which appears in the middle of the window. The global options panel allows you to change certain global properties that affect the environment as a whole, not necesarily any individual item.

×Play/Pause Button (Hotkey: P) - In the bottom right corner of your screen, there is a play button that when clicked, will play or pause the environment until the button is clicked again.
